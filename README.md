# JAVA-STUDENT-MANAGEMENT-PROJECT
# Student Management System (Console-Based Java Project)


## Project Title
Student Management System (SMS)

## Overview of the Project
The Student Management System is a console-based Java application designed to help users manage basic student information. The project demonstrates core Java concepts including object-oriented programming, file handling, layered architecture, and input validation. Data is saved persistently using a CSV file so that student records are retained even after the program is closed. The system provides basic CRUD operations along with a simple reporting feature.

## Features
1. Add Student  
   Allows the user to enter student details including name, age, and course.

2. View All Students  
   Displays all stored student records.

3. Update Student  
   Allows modification of an existing student’s information using their unique ID.

4. Delete Student  
   Removes a specific student record.

5. Generate Report  
   Shows the total number of students, the average age, and the number of students enrolled in each course.

6. File Persistence  
   Data is stored in a CSV file located in the "data" folder. The file is created automatically at runtime if it does not exist.

## Technologies / Tools Used
- Java (version 11 or above)
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended IDE)
- CSV file storage
- Core Java libraries only, no external frameworks
